Load balancers are networking devices or software applications responsible for distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers or backend resources. They act as intermediaries between clients (such as web browsers or applications) and servers, enhancing the performance, reliability, and scalability of web-based applications and services.

The primary functions of load balancers include:

Traffic Distribution: Load balancers evenly distribute incoming requests (such as HTTP requests in web applications) among multiple backend servers based on predefined algorithms. This helps to prevent any single server from becoming overloaded while ensuring that all servers are effectively utilized.
High Availability: Load balancers monitor the health and status of backend servers and automatically route traffic away from servers that are experiencing issues, such as high load or failure. This improves the availability and reliability of applications by reducing the impact of server failures.
