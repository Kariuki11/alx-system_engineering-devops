Sure! Let's delve into the process of creating a function to query the Reddit API for the number of subscribers in a subreddit, step by step, without the code snippets.

### 1. Understanding the Task

The objective is to write a Python function that:
- Accepts a subreddit name as input.
- Queries the Reddit API to fetch the number of subscribers for that subreddit.
- Returns 0 if the subreddit is invalid or doesn't exist.

### 2. Reddit API Basics

Reddit provides an API to access its data programmatically. For this task, you will use the specific API endpoint designed to retrieve information about a subreddit. The URL format for this endpoint is:
`https://www.reddit.com/r/{subreddit}/about.json`

You replace `{subreddit}` with the name of the subreddit you are querying.

### 3. Making HTTP Requests

To interact with the Reddit API, you will use the `requests` library in Python. This library simplifies sending HTTP requests and handling responses.

#### Key Points to Handle:
- **User-Agent Header**: Reddit requires a custom User-Agent header to identify your application, which helps avoid issues like rate limiting or request blocking.
- **Redirects**: Invalid subreddits might cause a redirect to a search page. You need to ensure your request does not automatically follow redirects.
- **Error Handling**: Handle potential errors such as network issues or invalid responses gracefully to ensure your function returns 0 in case of any problems.

### 4. Function Design

#### Steps for Function Implementation:

1. **Construct the URL**: Create the URL by substituting the subreddit name into the endpoint URL.
2. **Set Headers**: Include a custom User-Agent header in your request to comply with Reddit's requirements.
3. **Send the Request**: Use the `requests` library to send a GET request to the Reddit API.
4. **Check the Response**: Verify if the response status code is 200 (OK). If it is, parse the response to extract the number of subscribers. If the status code is not 200, return 0.
5. **Handle Exceptions**: Catch any exceptions that might occur during the request and ensure the function returns 0 in case of an error.

### 5. Usage Example

A script (`0-main.py`) is provided to test your function:
- The script imports the `number_of_subscribers` function.
- It checks if a subreddit name is passed as a command-line argument.
- It calls the function with the given subreddit name and prints the result.

### 6. Testing

To test your function:
1. Save the function in a file named `0-subs.py`.
2. Save the test script in a file named `0-main.py`.
3. Run the script from the command line with a subreddit name as an argument.

### Conclusion

By following these detailed steps, you can create a function that queries the Reddit API for the number of subscribers of a subreddit and handles any potential issues gracefully. This involves constructing the appropriate URL, setting the required headers, handling redirects and errors, and ensuring the function behaves correctly for both valid and invalid subreddits.
