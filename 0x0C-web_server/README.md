A web server is a software application or hardware device that serves content to users over the internet or an intranet. It responds to requests from clients (such as web browsers) by providing resources, such as HTML files, images, or other types of data.

Common web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and others. They typically support various protocols, including HTTP and HTTPS, and provide functionalities such as hosting websites, handling requests, and managing connections.
