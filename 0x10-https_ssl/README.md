To configure HTTPS/SSL for your web application, you typically need to follow these steps:

Obtain an SSL Certificate: You need to obtain an SSL certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA). This certificate will verify the authenticity of your website and encrypt data transmitted between the server and the client.
Install the SSL Certificate: After obtaining the SSL certificate, you need to install it on your web server. This process may vary depending on the server software you're using (e.g., Apache, Nginx, IIS). Generally, it involves uploading the certificate files to your server and configuring the server to use them.
Configure HTTPS: Once the SSL certificate is installed, you need to configure your web server to use HTTPS. This involves updating the server configuration to listen for HTTPS connections on port 443 and specifying the location of the SSL certificate files.
Redirect HTTP to HTTPS: Forcing HTTPS ensures that all traffic to your website is encrypted. You can achieve this by configuring your web server to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS. This can be done using server-side configuration or by implementing redirects in your application code.
Test and Monitor: After configuring HTTPS, it's important to test your website to ensure that HTTPS is working correctly. You should also monitor your website for any issues related to SSL certificate expiration, certificate chain errors, or insecure content warnings.
