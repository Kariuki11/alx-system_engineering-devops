Loops: Loops in programming allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. There are mainly two types of loops:

For Loop: This loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, or string) and executes the block of code for each item in the sequence.
While Loop: This loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
