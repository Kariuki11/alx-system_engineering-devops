The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose and provides a standardized interface for the layer above and below it. The OSI model is not a tangible implementation but rather a guideline for developing network protocols and communication systems.
