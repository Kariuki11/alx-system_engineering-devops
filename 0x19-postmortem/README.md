**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage**

---

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** June 1, 2024, 14:00 - 16:30 UTC (2.5 hours)
- **Impact:** Users experienced significant slowdowns and intermittent outages on our e-commerce platform. Approximately 70% of users were affected, resulting in failed transactions and a surge in customer complaints.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfigured database index caused a severe bottleneck, leading to high latency and eventual service disruption.

---

**Timeline:**

- **14:00 UTC:** Issue detected via a sudden spike in latency alerts from our monitoring system.
- **14:05 UTC:** Initial investigation by the on-call engineer; database performance was suspected.
- **14:15 UTC:** Detailed database metrics reviewed; assumptions pointed to a potential deadlock or resource contention.
- **14:30 UTC:** Misleading path: Network latency checks performed, no anomalies found.
- **14:45 UTC:** Escalation to the database team; further analysis of slow query logs initiated.
- **15:00 UTC:** Discovered misconfigured index on the 'orders' table causing query slowness.
- **15:30 UTC:** Index rebuilt and database performance restored; monitoring for stability commenced.
- **16:30 UTC:** Issue fully resolved, and service confirmed stable.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured index on the 'orders' table in our PostgreSQL database. This index, intended to speed up queries, was not optimized correctly and instead caused severe performance degradation. Specifically, the index included columns that were frequently updated, leading to excessive lock contention and slow query execution times.

**Resolution:**
To resolve the issue, the database team first identified the problematic index through slow query logs and database performance metrics. The team then dropped the misconfigured index and created a new, optimized index that excluded frequently updated columns. This action reduced lock contention and improved query performance. Post-resolution monitoring confirmed that the database performance was restored to acceptable levels, and no further issues were detected.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

**Improvements/Fixes:**

1. **Database Index Management:**
   - Regularly review and optimize database indexes to ensure they are correctly configured.
   - Implement automated tools to detect and alert on poorly performing indexes.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring to include detailed performance metrics for database operations.
   - Set up alerts for long-running queries and high lock contention.

3. **Incident Response Procedures:**
   - Update incident response playbook to include detailed steps for diagnosing database performance issues.
   - Conduct regular training for engineers on database performance tuning and troubleshooting.

**Task List:**

1. **Patch PostgreSQL Configuration:**
   - Update PostgreSQL configuration to include recommended settings for high-performance indexing.
2. **Implement Monitoring Tools:**
   - Add monitoring tools such as pg_stat_statements and pgBadger for detailed query analysis.
3. **Review and Optimize Indexes:**
   - Conduct a full review of existing indexes on production databases.
   - Optimize or drop indexes that negatively impact performance.
4. **Incident Playbook Update:**
   - Update the incident response playbook with detailed guidelines for database performance issues.
   - Schedule regular incident simulation drills to ensure readiness.
5. **Engineer Training:**
   - Organize training sessions on database indexing and performance tuning for the engineering team.
   - Provide access to relevant documentation and resources for continuous learning.

**Conclusion:**

While this outage was a significant disruption, it has provided valuable insights into our database management practices. By implementing the corrective measures outlined above, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure a more robust and reliable service for our users. Thank you for your patience and understanding during this time.
